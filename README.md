## About

Horde is an open-source gamification platform designed to boost user engagement and retention.

## Features

Here's what horde offers:
- Virtual Currency: Create and manage your own in-app currency, whether it's coins, gems, or any other collectible. Horde provides a secure and easy-to-use currency management system.
- Rewards and Badges: Motivate users with badges, levels, and special powers. You can even reward users with physical goods, creating a balanced and rewarding experience.
- Community Building: Foster user interaction through community spaces where they can share achievements and experiences. (Coming soon!)
- Contests and Leaderboards: Engage users with contests and leaderboards, providing a platform for friendly competition. (Coming soon!)


Gamification isnâ€™t about turning your business into a game but about rewarding users in meaningful ways that keep them coming back for more.
